# Coding Environment

## Overview

The coding environment enables AI agents to solve programming tasks by implementing solutions that pass test suites. This environment is designed for algorithm implementation and testing agent coding capabilities.

## Architecture

The coding environment follows the same pattern as game environments:

- **State Management**: `CodingState` tracks step number, task name, test results, and completion status
- **Step Execution**: `run_step()` validates commands, executes them, detects test runs, and checks completion
- **Agent Factory**: `agent.py` handles initialization, checkpoint restoration, and the main agent loop
- **Entry Point**: `entry_point.py` sets up the workspace and copies task files

## Task Structure

Each coding task is a directory under `tasks/` with the following structure:

```
tasks/<task_name>/
├── description.md      # Problem statement and examples
├── solution.py         # Starter code template for agent to edit
└── test_solution.py    # Pytest test cases that solution must pass
```

### Example Task: two_sum

```
tasks/two_sum/
├── description.md      # Two Sum problem description
├── solution.py         # Template with `two_sum()` function stub
└── test_solution.py    # 8 test cases covering edge cases
```

## Success Criteria

A task is considered **complete** when:
1. The agent runs pytest on the test file
2. All tests pass (exit code 0, pytest reports "N passed")
3. No tests fail

The environment automatically:
- Detects pytest execution
- Parses test output for pass/fail status
- Updates state and terminates when all tests pass

## Configuration

Coding tasks are configured via YAML files:

```yaml
environment: coding

agent:
  model: openai/gpt-5       # Provider/model format
  max_steps: 20             # Maximum steps before timeout

task:
  name: two_sum             # Task directory name
  language: python          # Programming language

prompts:
  system_prompt: |
    <agent capabilities and tool calling instructions>

  user_prompt: |
    <task description with {task_name} and {language} variables>
```

## Workspace Setup

When a container starts:

1. `entry_point.py` loads the config
2. Task files are copied from `/opt/tasks/<task_name>/` to `/agent/`
3. Working directory is set to `/agent/`
4. Agent begins execution with access to:
   - `description.md` (problem statement)
   - `solution.py` (editable file)
   - `test_solution.py` (test file)

## Checkpointing

The coding environment supports full checkpoint/resume:

- **Checkpoint**: Saves at each step to `/tmp/output/step-N/`
  - `state.json`: Step number, task info, test results
  - `messages.json`: Full conversation history
  - `workspace/`: Complete copy of workspace directory

- **Resume**: Loads from `/opt/checkpoint/`
  - Restores state and messages
  - Restores workspace files
  - Continues from next step

## Running Tasks

### Build the Docker image:
```bash
./scripts/build_container.sh --coding
```

### Run a task:
```bash
./scripts/run.sh configs/code/two_sum.yaml
```

### Resume from checkpoint:
```bash
./scripts/resume.sh ./results/coding/<model>/<timestamp>/run-1/step-5
```

## Creating New Tasks

1. Create task directory: `environments/coding/tasks/<task_name>/`
2. Add three files:
   - `description.md`: Problem statement
   - `solution.py`: Starter code with function stubs
   - `test_solution.py`: Pytest test cases

3. Create config: `configs/code/<task_name>.yaml`
   - Set `task.name` to match directory name
   - Customize prompts as needed

4. Rebuild Docker image to include new task

## Test Suite

Run all coding environment tests:
```bash
./tests/environments/coding/run_all_coding.sh
```

This runs:
- Fresh run of two_sum task
- Resume from checkpoint
- Validates checkpoint restoration and completion detection

## Output Format

Each step creates:
- `state.json`: Coding state (step, task_name, test_results, task_completed)
- `messages.json`: Full conversation history
- `workspace/`: Current state of all workspace files

Final output includes test results and completion status.

## Current Limitations

- Python only (extendable to other languages)
- Single-file tasks (can be extended to multi-file projects)
- Test-based success only (no code quality metrics)
- No network access (intentional isolation)

## Extension Points

To add support for:
- **Other languages**: Update Dockerfile with language tools, modify test detection
- **Multi-file projects**: Update task structure and workspace setup
- **Code quality**: Add linting/formatting detection to `run_step.py`
- **Performance testing**: Add benchmarking to success criteria
