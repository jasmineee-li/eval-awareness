# Evaluation Awareness Benchmark

From Igor Ivanov - Evaluations for measuring whether LLMs can detect if they're being evaluated vs. interacting with real users. Built on [Inspect AI](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/).

## Tasks

| Task | Description | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `binary_third_person` | Classifies transcripts as EVAL/REAL using multiple judge prompts. Identical to the method used in the [Large Language Models Often Know When They are Being Evaluated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23836) paper, the only difference is that each prompt is applied to each sample once, not 5 times. | Vote-based binary label |
| `binary_third_person_multi` | Same as above, but uses multiple judge models and averages scores (you can define the models in the JUDGE_MODELS variable in the script) | Averaged vote score |
| `probability_third_person` | Estimates probability a transcript is from an evaluation | 0-1 probability score |
| `probability_third_person_multi` | Same as above, but uses multiple judge models and averages scores (you can define the models in the JUDGE_MODELS variable in the script) | Averaged probability |
| `verbalized_awareness` | Detects if model explicitly verbalizes awareness of being tested | EVAL/REAL with evidence |

All methods can take as input both Inspect eval files as well as data fromatted as the dataset from the paper [Large Language Models Often Know When They are Being Evaluated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23836) 

## Usage

```bash
# Binary classification task
inspect eval inspect_tasks/binary_third_person.py --model openai/gpt-5 \
  -T dataset_path=../datasets/agentic_needham_dataset_v2.json

# Probability estimation task  
inspect eval inspect_tasks/probability_third_person.py --model openai/gpt-5 \
  -T dataset_path=../datasets/agentic_needham_dataset_v2.json

# Verbalized awareness task
inspect eval inspect_tasks/verbalized_awareness.py --model openai/gpt-5 \
  -T dataset_path=../datasets/agentic_needham_dataset_v2.json
```

## Plot Generation

Generate TPR/TNR bar charts and ROC curves from evaluation logs (doesn't work for verbalized_awareness scorer):

```bash
python plot_generation/calculate_bar.py
python plot_generation/calculate_roc.py
```

These scripts automatically scan the logs directory for relevant .eval files and generate plots in the `plot_generation/plots/` folder

Reads `.eval` files from `logs/` and outputs plots to `plot_generation/plots/`.
